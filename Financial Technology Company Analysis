 **INDUSTRY**
 
 Financial Technology:  the ecosystem within alternative finance made up of companies, technology, and processes that aim to improve traditional methods of finance Alternative finance refers to forms of finance that are outside the institutional finance system of banks and capital markets. The broad range of credit choices offered to consumers and business owners is referred to as alternative lending. 

 **COMPANY**

 LendingClub Corportaion operates as a bank holding company for LendingClub Bank, National Association that provides a range of financial products and services through a technology driven platform. The company provides personal, educational, small business, commercial and equipment loans. LendingClub Corporation was incorporated in 2006 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.  Renaud Laplanche co-founded and served for a decade as the CEO.

 Renaud Laplanche (former CEO) had gotten the idea for the new company at the time when he started TripleHop and found that his credit card carried an 18% interest rate, while he was only earning 1.5% from the bank on high yield certificates of deposit. He thought that by connecting investors directly with borrowers, he could cut the banks out of the equation and deliver lower rates for borrowers and higher returns for investors.  Digital-first lending services are accessed more frequently, the marketplace is earning customers’ trust faster, an industry with rapid growth, and partnering more closely with banking partners. 

 In 2010, after receiving $12 million in funding from venture capital investors, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding. Victoria Barret, "Making Personal Loans For Fun And Profit" Forbes December 2, 2010. 
In August 2011, LendingClub raised an additional $25 million in venture capital.  By June 2012, the company had raised $100 million in venture capital. This led to a $570 million valuation of the company.  Sarah McBride Mary Meeker breaks her investment fast Reuters 6 June 2012. Retrieved 15 March 2013.  LendingClub completed its IPO on December 10, 2014 and shares increased 56% on their first day of trading, valuing the company at $8.5bn.

**DISRUPTION**

Following years of disappointing results for investors, LendingClub looked like the comeback kid with its 2020 announcement of the acquisition of Radius Bank, which gave the company a bank charter and the chance to combine its loan business with a burgeoning challenger bank. The company completed the acquisition in 2021, entering into competition with its competitors that are also vying to combine innovative loan programs with neobanks. Despite the success of the purchase and the division’s relatively high margins, the company’s stock has been hammered in the recent market selloff as investors increasingly question the high premium they are paying in return for promise of future profits (LendingClub was still trading at 94 times earnings during the collection period, though it expects 7x higher net income in 2022).

LendingClub provides the following:
1.	Easier to make a transaction
2.	Optimizes the experience
3.	Financially inclusive for a wider market
4.	Provides better quality, results, & affordability
5.	Incentivizing the use of the online Apps

**FUTURE**

Since the Radius Bank acquisition, LendingClub has been busy finding ways to best leverage the company’s assets to bring them in line with its overall strategy to target “everyday Americans” rather than the high-income market that LendingClub has historically found success in. The company announced in January that it would end Radius’ yacht loans business and reevaluate their relationships with several fintech partners that cater to the upper class, though it did not specify which partners that would include. The company is also expanding its auto refinance and purchase financing businesses, both of which cater more directly to the middle class and are easier to tackle now that the company has funding from its banking division.

*“Consumers want financial services that are seamless and on their terms, and they want personalized and predictive tools and information so that they can make better and faster decisions.”* – Scott Sanborn CEO on a January 2022 earnings call.

**"Protocol" article by Ryan Deffenbaugh and published online on October 26, 2022:** 

"LendingClub's earnings on Wednesday offered a worrying sign for fintech lenders — even as the lender-turned-digital bank holds what could be a key advantage during hard times. The San Francisco company’s third-quarter earnings Wednesday of $0.41 per share topped analyst expectations. But the firm's share price was still trading down by nearly 10% in after-market trading, some of which may be in response to gloomy fourth-quarter projections. The firm sounded a warning to the market. LendingClub originates some of its loans and then sells them to investors, an arrangement often called marketplace lending. "As we anticipated, marketplace volumes were impacted by higher funding costs for certain loan investors, driven by rapidly increasing interest rates," CEO Scott Sanborn said in the earnings release. The company reported an 8% quarterly decline in the total value of its loan originations, driven by a decrease in marketplace loans.

Investors in consumer debt are seeking higher yields and getting pickier as interest rates rise. That has put a squeeze on marketplace lenders.  LendingClub can reprice its loans to meet those higher funding costs over time, but Sanborn said the company needs to remain competitive against credit card rates, as the majority of its personal loans are people refinancing credit card debt. LendingClub is not alone in relying on the marketplace model. Upstart, which reports earnings on Nov. 8, has already described constraints on its funding. The good news for LendingClub is that it is no longer solely reliant on the marketplace. LendingClub last year completed a $185 million acquisition of Radius Bank, giving it the banking charter required to hold deposits and directly fund its loans. While the $2.4 billion in originations that LendingClub sold to investors in the quarter is down about 15% from the three months prior, the $1.2 billion in loan originations that LendingClub is holding onto was a 13% increase.  

LendingClub is now holding onto 33% of its loans, compared to 20% one year ago. The spread between the interest LendingClub is paying depositors and collecting from borrowers, or net interest income, climbed 89% year-over-year to $123.7 million last quarter. "The benefits of our bank capabilities could not be more clear," Sanborn said.  Still, the company is projecting $255 million to $265 million in revenues for next quarter, which would mark a decrease up to 16% from the $304.9 million it reported in the third quarter. That could be driving the negative initial reaction on Wall Street. LendingClub's share price is down 54% from the start of the year but had shown signs of recovery, climbing 4% over the past month. 

Sanborn last quarter compared LendingClub to a car reducing its speed while approaching a curve, with plans to accelerate coming out of it. "We are in the curve right now," he said. "But as we look further down the track I would note that some of the negative dynamics in today's market will point to future opportunity. Most notably, record high credit card balances at record high interest rates should be a boon to our core refinance business. Our marketplace revenue has a proven ability to quickly rebound." 

A Wedbush report called LendingClub's quarterly results mixed but maintained an outperform label. "We like the company's new business model following the acquisition of Radius Bank last year, enabling high-yielding consumer loans to be held on-balance sheet funded by lower-cost deposit funding," the report said.  LendingClub's total deposits of $5.1 billion were up 80% from last year."
