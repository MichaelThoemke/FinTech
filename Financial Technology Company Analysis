**DISRUPTION**

Following years of disappointing results for investors, LendingClub looked like the comeback kid with its 2020 announcement of the acquisition of Radius Bank, which gave the company a bank charter and the chance to combine its loan business with a burgeoning challenger bank. The company completed the acquisition in 2021, entering into competition with its competitors that are also vying to combine innovative loan programs with neobanks. Despite the success of the purchase and the division’s relatively high margins, the company’s stock has been hammered in the recent market selloff as investors increasingly question the high premium they are paying in return for promise of future profits (LendingClub was still trading at 94 times earnings during the collection period, though it expects 7x higher net income in 2022).

**FUTURE**

Since the Radius Bank acquisition, LendingClub has been busy finding ways to best leverage the company’s assets to bring them in line with its overall strategy to target “everyday Americans” rather than the high-income market that LendingClub has historically found success in. The company announced in January that it would end Radius’ yacht loans business and reevaluate their relationships with several fintech partners that cater to the upper class, though it did not specify which partners that would include. The company is also expanding its auto refinance and purchase financing businesses, both of which cater more directly to the middle class and are easier to tackle now that the company has funding from its banking division.
